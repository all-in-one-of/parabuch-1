# Place for projects too small and fragile to have their own places. #
They normally get lost in time during disk format, so I place them here one by one in spare time.


## Today in menu: ##
  * [tiit](tiit.md) - tiny image inspection tool (yet another iinfo utility)
  * [vol2bgeo](vol2bgeo.md) - volume bgeo converter for synthesized tile-able solid textures.
  * [wlnoise](wlnoise.md) - Wavelet Noise for VEX.
  * mitsuba\_rop - basic Houdini support for Mitsuba renderer.
  * [SOP\_PointCache](SOP_PointCache.md) - reads PC2 cache files, interpolates samples, obeys start frame.
  * [SOP\_IntersectRay](SOP_IntersectRay.md) - detects self-interections in geometry (for animation debugging purpose).
  * COP2\_Wavelets  - performs discreet and continuous wavelet transform and its inverse on images (heavily unfinished).
  * inuke - python wrapper making Nuke a command line utility (like shake used to be).

## Dishes which may appear (sooner, later, never): ##

  * ndist (ray hit) - closest surface ray hit for VEX.
  * channel COP - chop->image.
  * ~~Rat reader for Nuke.~~ (Moved out to own place).
  * various IBL filtering algorithms.







## So what is 'parabuch' anyway? ##

It's taken from here:
```
"(...)
First a toot! (Nagle - świst!)
Then a hoot! (Potem - gwizd!) 
Steam is churning, (Para buch!)
Wheels are turning! (Koła w ruch!)

More slowly - than turtles - with freight - on their - backs, 
The drowsy - steam engine - sets off - down the tracks. 
She chugs and she tugs at her wagons with strain, 
As wheel after wheel slowly turns on the train. 
She doubles her effort and quickens her pace, 
And rambles and scrambles to keep up the race. (...)"
